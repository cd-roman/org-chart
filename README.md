# Getting Started with Vite

This project is now powered by [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), a fast and modern build tool for React apps.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in development mode.  

The page will reload when you make changes.  
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.  
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

### `npm run preview`

Serves the production build locally for previewing.
